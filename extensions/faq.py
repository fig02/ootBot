'As a beginner you have many options to start running this game. Here are some common suggestions: \n\n\
GSR - This category is very commonly recommended to beginners. It involves completing Shadow, Spirit, \
and doing most of Forest before beating the game. The category will teach you a lot of fundamentals that will \
carry over to more advanced categories. A common downside cited about this category is mainly the amount of \
cutscenes you have to sit through. There is a tutorial in the resources section.\n\n\
No Wrong Warp (SRM) - This run is a good introduction to SRM. It\'s comprised of doing LightNode SRM to gain control \
during the title screen to become adult with a ton of items available in the game. Within a few minutes of starting \
the game, you\'re able to go and open the rainbow bridge and beat Ganon.\n\n\
Glitchless - This category is great to start with because it focuses more on movement than anything else. \
This lays the groundwork for being fast at other categories. A 4 hour run is pretty long for beginners, but \
if you are okay with the length, this is another great starting point. For obvious reasons, this category \
has a lot of cutscenes too. Join the glitchless discord for more help centered around specifically glitchless. \n\n\
Defeat Ganon (No SRM) - If you like the idea of starting out with a really short run, this is perfect. \
It wont give you as much experience with stuff that applies to other categories, but it\'s still a \
great starting point. People usually recommend you start with the Kakariko route which gets the bottle normally, \
but you can start out with GIM if you are ambitious. A Kak route tutorial is in the resources channel.\n\n\
You can start with any of the other categories, these are just the most commonly suggested starting points. \
In the end you should run what you find most interesting. There are other non RTA options like Bingo as well.')

	async def cspointer(self, ctx):

'Specific cutscenes will set a value which is very important for wrong warps called the “Cutscene Pointer”. \
In the context of an Any% Speedrun, this value is last set by the cutscene that plays when you enter the Deku Tree.\n\
If for whatever reason you need to reset the game after that cutscene, your CS Pointer gets set to the value for the title \
screen cutscene. Having this CS Pointer will mean that you will softlock after successfully performing the wrong warp.\n\
Luckily there is an easy way to fix this. Depending on your version, you can pause in a specific area to fix the relevant \
values. The fix is language and version specific. For the Japanese version:\n\
> 1.0 - pause the game in Link’s house\n\
> 1.1 - pause the game in House of Twins\n\
> 1.2 - pause the game in Link’s house\n\
After you have paused and unpaused the game in this location, the wrong warp will work again as long as your CS Pointer is \
still the title screen. \nA long explanation on the pause trick can be found here: <https://pastebin.com/WEkVWVWt>\n\
Also note: on the Practice ROM you can go to `warps > clear cs pointer` and it will make any wrong warp work regardless of your last cutscene.')

This is important for performing the Wrong Warp, because if Link doesn’t walk through the door at the right speed at the end of \
the setup, the warp timer value will not be correct.\n\n\
In a run context, the last loading zone before Gohma is entering The Deku Tree. This loading zone has a hard coded speed. No matter \
how fast or slow you enter it, it is the same. This means in runs you have nothing to worry about. However, in practice, if you warp to \
Gohmas room with the Practice ROM, chances are your warp speed is off and it will not work. You need to warp to Deku Tree *then* warp to \
Gohma for your loading zone speed value to be correct.')
